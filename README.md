Design Patterns Implemented

    🔧 Singleton Pattern
Our application extensively uses the Singleton Design Pattern to ensure:
    >Configuration Management - Centralized application settings
    >Session Management - Consistent user state handling
    >API Response Formatting - Uniform response structure

    🔄 API-First Approach
We implemented a clean separation of concerns by decoupling the frontend from the backend:

Frontend - Pure client-side rendering with API consumption
Backend - RESTful API serving JSON responses
This architecture provides:

Scalability - Independent scaling of frontend and backend
Maintainability - Clear separation of presentation and business logic
Flexibility - Easy integration with mobile apps or third-party services
Performance - Optimized API responses and caching strategies

Layer	Technology	Purpose
Frontend REACT.js TailwindCSS
Backend	EXPRESS.js
Database	MySQL 8.0+	
Architecture	RESTful API
Communication	JSON	Client-server data exchange
